                Hi! I’m a student currently learning web development and programming. I enjoy working with Visual Basic and exploring how different coding languages interact with web technologies. When I’m not coding, I’m interested in tech trends, gadgets, and learning about different cultures—Nigeria has been a recent area of interest for me!

In my free time, I like to listen to music, and I’m curious about what it takes to produce it. This page is part of my journey into web publishing, and I’m excited to keep building my skills!
